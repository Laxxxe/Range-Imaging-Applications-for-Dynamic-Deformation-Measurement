\section[Introduction]{Introduction}\label{sec:motivation}
New innovations in semiconductor technologies offer nowadays multiple new kinds of measurement procedures in test facilities. Modern imaging measurement methods like Time Of Flight or Particle Image Velocimetry work with a complex interaction of Camera and Illumination. This methods depend on a precise synchronization between the exposure of the camera and the pulsed illumination of the scene. In this thesis I will describe multiple techniques for pulsed illumination in facilities for aerodynamic, propulsion-, structural- and crash testing. One major part will be about the Kinect 2, a 3D Sensor on the Time-Of-Flight principle that allows you to gather 3D Data with 30 fps on high resolution. High Power illumination like Chip on Board LEDs or Solid-state lasers deliver the light sources for this technique.
