The work described in this thesis would not be possible without the extensive support from Prof. Funke and the team of propulsion laboratory at the University of Applied Science Aachen. From the rough idea to the finished experimental results I got a lot of support and feedback that helped me to find the right way even if the tasks seemed impossible to fulfill. Prof. Kameier from the University of Applied Science Duesseldorf delivered us a high precision reference measurement device. He also contributed Matlab source code that was necessary for the evaluation. I would also like to thanks Prof. Franke who allocated the oscilloscope for the acquisition of the Laser Doppler Vibrometer. Many thanks goes also to my family and friends, who supported me over the last months, corrected my texts and gave me a lot of feedback.
